I am a PhD student studying mosquito sugar feeding and plant interactions in the Biochemistry Department at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg , VA. I am interested in all types of insect chemical ecology, but mosquitoes fascinate me especially because of their complex interactions with both animal and plant sources of nutrients.

I am a current Virginia Tech [Global Change Center Graduate Fellow](https://globalchange.vt.edu/graduate/interdisciplinary-phd-training.html) and I am supported by the College of Agriculture and Life Science [Graduate Teaching Scholars](https://www.cals.vt.edu/academic-programs/current/graduate/gts/gts-application-instructions.html) Program.
