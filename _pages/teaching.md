I am a graduate TA for BCHM 4354: Biochemical Communication at Virginia Tech. As a part of the Graduate Teaching Scholars Progam, I take increased responibility for teaching the course. Currently, I give 20% of the lectures and assist with organization. I am expected to take over 50% of the teaching and planning duties in Spring 2027 and will become the intrutor of record in Spring 2028.

As I continue to further my own education, I want to take action to help others further theirs. I decided to join the Graduate Teaching Scholars program so that I can gain the educational skills and outreach experience that I need to be an effective educator and scientist. The GTS program represents another step in reaching my career goals and compliments my existing teaching and mentoring experiences. The GTS program includes 10 credit hours of course work dedicated to improving teaching skills. It also provides 36 months of guaranteed funding.
